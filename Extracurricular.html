					<h2>Marching Band - Clarinet</h2>
					<img src="images/GBMB.jpg" style="float: left; padding-right: 1%;">
					<h3>2010 – 2018</h3>
					<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In highschool, I played the clarinet. I was in the marching band for all four years.
						After that, I went to community college where I wrote some music and played it with a piano duet since my community college did not have a marching band. Once I transfered into CU, I joined the Golden Buffalo Marching Band where I played for two years. After that, my studies were getting demanding, so I retired playing the clarinet.
					Every year I would need to balance attending practice and shows while practicing my clarinet, completing my studies, and attending my job. It was a lot of work, but I always made it manage and had a lot of fun while doing it!
